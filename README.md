# Wound-Detection-App-NUSRI
This project aims to develop a mobile App to be able to scan the wound regions and detect the infected region on a regular basis for doctors to decide most effective and timely treatments needed. Certain segmentation algorithms are used to develop this AI-based medical app for medical personnel used in the skin wound therapy.
